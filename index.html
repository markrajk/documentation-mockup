              <h1>[GA4] Dimensions and metrics</h1>
              <p>
                This article describes the <a href="#">dimensions</a> and
                <a href="#">metrics</a> that appear in your reports and
                explorations and in the audience and segment builders. You can
                also access these dimensions and metrics outside of Analytics
                using the <a href="#">Google Analytics Data API.</a> If you want
                to collect information that Analytics doesn't capture with these
                dimensions and metrics, you can create your own custom
                dimensions and metrics. To find a dimension or metric, search
                this article (using Ctrl+F or Command+F on your keyboard) or use
                the <a href="#">GA4 Dimensions & Metrics Explorer</a> to see the
                dimensions and metrics for a given property.

              <h2>How they're populated</h2>
              <p>
                Some dimensions and metrics are populated automatically when you
                <a href="#">add the global site tag (gtag.js)</a> to your
                website or
                <a href="#">add the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK</a> to
                your mobile or web application. Other dimensions and metrics
                require some configuration before they're populated (as
                described in the following sections).

              <h2>Grayed-out dimensions and metrics</h2>
              <p>
                A dimension or metric may be grayed out when the dimension or
                metric is <a href="#">incompatible</a> with other dimensions or
                metrics that you applied to a report or exploration, or when you
                can't apply the dimension or metric to the selected exploration
                <a href="#">technique</a>.

              <h2>What the value (not set) means</h2>
              <p>
                (not set) is a placeholder name that Google Analytics uses when
                it hasn't received information for a dimension. The following
                sections describe how to populate each dimension so that you
                don't see the (not set) value. When you send an empty value to
                Analytics, you will see a blank value instead of (not set); (not
                set) appears when no value is sent.
